Jesus defeated evil through his life, death, and resurrection.
This message matters not to me but to **the whole world**

## Here's the story of the gospel in a nutshell:
1. God created a good world with order and purpose
2. Man broke God's rules and now the world is disorderly and suffers
3. God promised to redeem the world through a descendant of that original man
4. Jesus is the promised descendant who redeemed the world by obeying God's rule and enduring punishment so we don't have to
5. God now commands us to die to ourselves and live for him by faith in Jesus
